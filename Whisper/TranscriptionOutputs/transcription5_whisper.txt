 of brain health and the types of conditions that you see most consistently in the patients that end up in your clinics. Well, can I say with the controversy just a little bit longer because it really irritates me. The people criticize me, say, oh, he's only doing it for money. Oh, you can't see these things in the scans even though they're not experts. But what's the alternative? I mean, I'd said it earlier, psychiatrists are the only medical doctors who virtually never look at the organ they treat. Think about that. And obviously, if you have a brain dysfunction, that's going to dictate a mental health outcome. Well, if we agree that your brain controls everything you do, right? How you think, how you feel, how you act, how you get along with other people. And when it works right, you tend to work right. And when it's troubled, you're more likely to have trouble in your life. If your brain, the moment by moment function of your brain, creates your mind, then why wouldn't you assess the organ that you're working on? And so just a little more history in 1993, I start to get anxious because I have two big flaws. And then I've worked on them a lot, but I like people to like me. And you can't change a medical specialty if you're anxious about what people think of you. And I hate conflict. I'm a middle child. You and I both. I hate conflict. And I like people to like me. And all that changed in 1995. So I spent from 1993 to 1995 just anxious because I knew I had to do this, right? There's not a choice. Once you look, you can't unlock. And 1995, I got a call late one night from my sister in law, Sherry, who told me my nine year old nephew Andrew had attacked a little girl on the baseball field. I know a particular reason. And I'm like, what? And she said, Danny, he's different. He's mean. He doesn't smile anymore. I went into his room today and found two pictures. He had drawn one of them. He was hanging from a tree. The other picture he was shooting other children.
