 really personal for me and I loved it. But I was already getting criticism from it. It's like, oh, we don't do this. It's not standard. It's not what we do. But 1992, all day seminar at the American Psychiatric Association, Brands Backed Imaging in Child Psychiatry, because I'm also a child psychiatrist. I'm so excited because I'm meeting colleagues who do it. In 1993, I teach with that group. So I'm like all in on the technology. But it was 1993, lots of pushback from the American Psychiatric Association because it doesn't fit the current diagnostic paradigm. It's like, stop giving people the diagnosis of depression. Depression's a symptom cluster. It shouldn't be a diagnosis. It's sort of like chest pain is a symptom. It's not a diagnosis, right? If you have chest pain, it doesn't tell you what's causing that and it doesn't tell you what to do for it, right? Right. It's just in Dishada, look deeper and use other diagnostic tools to confirm what's happening. But that was 20 years ago. Is there a sense that the medical establishment has changed its tune? Because if you look at your Wikipedia page, it's like a it's like a diatribe on the lack of scientific efficacy with respect to this imaging technology. I don't know what to do about Wikipedia. 2016 January, I've published 80 studies. People always never publish his work. It's like, dude, do you read Discover Magazine listed our research as one of the top 100 stories in science for 2015. That was pretty excited about that. 2021, the Canadian Association of Nuclear Medicine wrote procedure guidelines unspacked, basically as if I wrote them. And five of the 10 authors had been my students at some point, had 10,000 medical and mental health professionals referred to our 11 clinics. And 250,000 scans that you reviewed. So that's a people from 155. It's a massive data set. What are some of the general trends that you see? Like, what can you extract from that giant data set that speaks to brain health, the mutable?
